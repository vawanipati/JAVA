Here’s the updated draft with the rehabilitation period included:

Subject: Request for Work from Home Approval – December 2024

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request approval for a work-from-home arrangement from 1st December to 31st December 2024. My mother will be undergoing knee replacement surgery during this time, and she will require personal care both in the hospital and during her rehabilitation, which is expected to last for about three months after the operation.

During this period, I plan to manage her immediate post-surgery care, which is why I am requesting one month of remote work. I am confident I will be able to fulfill all my responsibilities and meet deadlines while working from home during this time.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or have concerns.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Vawani Pati

This now includes the mention of the rehabilitation period for context.
