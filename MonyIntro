Smurfing, also known as structuring, is a money laundering technique that involves breaking down large sums of money into smaller, less suspicious amounts, and then depositing them through multiple transactions. The term "smurfing" is derived from the fictional blue creatures called "Smurfs," who are small in size.

Here's how smurfing typically works:

1. Placement: At the initial stage of money laundering, the illicit funds are obtained from criminal activities. To avoid raising suspicion, criminals avoid depositing the entire amount at once into a single account.

2. Breaking Down the Funds: The criminals divide the large sum of money into smaller amounts, often below the threshold that would trigger the financial institution's reporting requirements. These thresholds vary depending on the country's regulations, but the aim is to stay below the radar of anti-money laundering measures.

3. Multiple Transactions: The launderers distribute the smaller amounts across various accounts or multiple financial institutions. They may use different branches or banks to further obscure the trail.

4. Layering: The launderers move the money between these accounts through various financial transactions, such as wire transfers, electronic transfers, or cash deposits, creating a complex web of transactions to hide the origin of the funds.

5. Integration: Once the funds have been layered and cleaned through multiple transactions, they are reintroduced into the economy as seemingly legitimate funds. This can be done by investing in assets, making purchases, or other means of integration into the financial system.

Smurfing is a popular money laundering method due to its simplicity and the ability to move large amounts of illicit funds without drawing too much attention. To combat smurfing and other money laundering techniques, financial institutions and authorities implement strict monitoring and reporting measures, such as the requirement to report large transactions, suspicious activities, and customer due diligence procedures.
