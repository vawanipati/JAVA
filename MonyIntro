Money laundering is the illegal process of making large amounts of money generated from criminal activities, such as drug trafficking or fraud, appear to have come from legitimate sources. It involves disguising the origins of illicit funds to make them appear as if they come from legal activities. This process helps criminals avoid detection and seize the proceeds of their unlawful activities. Money laundering is a serious crime and is subject to various laws and regulations worldwide to combat it effectively.
