Fingerprint authentication using quantum search faces several limitations. Current quantum computers are still experimental and may not be ready for large-scale deployment. The scalability of searching vast fingerprint databases could be constrained by qubit availability and error rates. High development and operational costs make the technology expensive to implement. Additionally, integrating quantum systems with existing infrastructure is complex, and there are ongoing concerns around data privacy and security.




In conclusion, while fingerprint authentication using quantum search offers significant potential in terms of speed and security, several limitations must be addressed for its practical implementation. The current state of quantum computing technology is still in its infancy, making large-scale deployment challenging and costly. Scalability concerns arise due to the vast fingerprint databases that require a substantial number of qubits, which are currently limited and prone to errors. Integrating quantum systems with existing payment infrastructure also presents significant technical complexities and requires specialized expertise. Additionally, the high costs associated with developing and maintaining quantum systems could limit their adoption to only the most critical applications. Security and privacy concerns are heightened with the use of biometric data, necessitating robust protections against potential quantum-specific threats. The user experience could also be impacted by latency issues or the quality of fingerprint scans, leading to potential reliability challenges. Furthermore, the legal and ethical implications of handling large-scale biometric data in a quantum context require careful consideration. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of quantum-enhanced fingerprint authentication make it a promising area for future research and development. Addressing these limitations will be key to realizing the full potential of this innovative technology.
