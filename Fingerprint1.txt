To calculate the number of qubits required for a fingerprint search using Grover's algorithm, we'll consider the following steps:

### 1. **Estimate the Number of Fingerprint Entries**
   - Suppose the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stores fingerprints for all banking customers in India. As of recent estimates, India has over **1.4 billion** people, but let's conservatively estimate that **500 million** banking customers have their fingerprints stored.

### 2. **Search Space and Grover's Algorithm**
   - The search space \( N \) is the total number of entries in the fingerprint database, which would be \( N = 500,000,000 \).
   - Grover's algorithm can search an unsorted database in approximately \( O(\sqrt{N}) \) steps. So, the number of iterations \( T \) required is \( T \approx \sqrt{N} \).

   \[
   T \approx \sqrt{500,000,000} \approx 22,360
   \]

### 3. **Quantum Circuit Depth and Response Time**
   - The time \( t \) required for a quantum operation is determined by the quantum circuit depth and the speed of quantum gates.
   - Assume each Grover iteration takes \( d \) quantum gate operations, and each gate operation takes \( \tau \) time.
   - If we want the response time \( t_{\text{response}} \) to be below 300 milliseconds, we have:

   \[
   t_{\text{response}} = T \times d \times \tau \leq 300 \text{ ms}
   \]

   Assuming modern quantum gates operate in the range of picoseconds to nanoseconds, let's take an optimistic \( \tau = 10 \) nanoseconds ( \( 10^{-9} \) seconds). For the sake of this calculation, assume \( d = 100 \) (a typical depth for a simple quantum circuit).

   \[
   t_{\text{response}} \approx 22,360 \times 100 \times 10^{-9} \text{ s} = 0.2236 \text{ seconds} = 223.6 \text{ milliseconds}
   \]

   This satisfies the response time constraint of under 300 milliseconds.

### 4. **Qubit Requirement**
   - The number of qubits \( n \) required to represent the search space is determined by \( N = 2^n \).
   - Solving for \( n \):

   \[
   2^n = 500,000,000
   \]

   Taking the logarithm:

   \[
   n \approx \log_2(500,000,000) \approx 29 \text{ qubits}
   \]

   Therefore, **29 qubits** are theoretically required to represent the search space of 500 million fingerprint entries.

### 5. **Additional Considerations**
   - **Error Correction**: Due to noise and decoherence in quantum systems, additional qubits will be needed for error correction. Depending on the error correction scheme, the actual number of qubits required could be significantly higher.
   - **Overhead**: The actual implementation might require additional qubits for operations like amplitude amplification and state preparation, potentially increasing the qubit count.

### Summary
For a database of 500 million fingerprints, Grover's algorithm would theoretically require around 29 qubits to represent the search space. With an assumed circuit depth and gate operation speed, this could allow a response time within the desired 300 milliseconds. However, the actual qubit requirement could be higher when considering error correction and other practical overheads.
